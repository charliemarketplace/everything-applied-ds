## 📝 Development Notes

### Dec 23, 2024 - Initial Scaffold
- Created SvelteKit project with TypeScript
- Configured Tailwind with custom obsidian/amber color scheme
- Built sidebar navigation with 13+ categories
- Completed 4 major interactive tutorial pages

### Dec 24, 2024 - Major Expansions
- Session 1: VaR, Time Series, Projections, Stress Testing, Vig, Market Making
- Session 2: Sharp/Square, Recency, Bandit, Ensemble, Brier, Churn
- Session 3: Prospect, Fandom, Game Theory, Sharpe, DiD, LTV, LP, Calibration
- Session 4: LogLoss, Features, Concentration

### Dec 25, 2024 - Continued Expansion
- Session 5: Injury, Elasticity, ROC-AUC, Cohort, Anchoring, Panel Data, Liability, Lineup, Competitive
- Session 6: CLV, Surge, Optimal Stopping, Markov Chains, Cross-Validation, Market Microstructure
- Session 7: Revenue Mgmt, Adverse Selection, MAE/RMSE, IV, Propensity, Hyperparameter Tuning
           Monte Carlo, Neural Networks, Survival Analysis, Unit Economics, Incrementality,
           Anomaly Detection, Hierarchical Models, Bayesian Updating, RL, Convex Optimization,
           Quadratic Programming, Data Pipelines, MLOps, Simulation Engines, Dashboards, Model Versioning
- Session 8 (Bug Fixes): 
  - Fixed Price Elasticity: Escaped `<` and `>` symbols in HTML text content
  - Fixed Prospect Theory: Changed `const` to `let` for bindable state variables
  - Fixed IV page: Removed non-existent ScatterChart import
  - Fixed Linear Programming: Escaped `<=` in R code block
  - Created `/ml/ensembling` page (was missing but linked in navigation)
  - Fixed Quadratic Programming: `sharpeRatio` was called as function but is a value
  - Optimized RL page: simplified Q-learning simulation to avoid heavy computation
  - Optimized Convex page: cached gradient descent result to avoid repeated calls
  - Optimized Quadratic page: cached portfolio metrics to avoid O(n²) recomputation

### Architecture Decisions
- Using Svelte 5 runes for reactivity
- Chart.js for visualizations
- Seeded RNG for reproducible synthetic data
- Dark theme with amber accents

### 🎉 PROJECT COMPLETE!
All 75 tutorial pages have been created covering:
- 17 categories of pricing models and frameworks
- Interactive demos on every page
- R code equivalents for all models
- Consistent styling and navigation
- Sports betting context throughout
