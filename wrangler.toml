# Cloudflare Pages configuration for static site deployment
# This site uses @sveltejs/adapter-static and outputs to the 'build' directory

name = "everything-applied-ds"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"

# Pages-specific configuration
pages_build_output_dir = "build"

# IMPORTANT: This is a static site. Use Cloudflare Pages, not Workers.
# 
# Deployment options:
# 1. Via CLI: npx wrangler pages deploy build --project-name=everything-applied-ds
# 2. Via GitHub: Connect repo in Cloudflare dashboard (recommended) - no deploy command needed
# 3. Via dashboard: Upload build directory manually
#
# DO NOT use: wrangler deploy (that's for Workers, not Pages)
